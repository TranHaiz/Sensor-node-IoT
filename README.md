This embedded systems project was developed as part of a course at my university. My team and I
collaborated to build a smart agriculture system. I was responsible for developing a sensor node using the
STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller, capable of measuring temperature and humidity (DHT11), CO2
concentration (SGP30), soil moisture (soil moisture sensor), and light intensity (photoresistor). The node
communicates with a central gateway via a Zigbee module
